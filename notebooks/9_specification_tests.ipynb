    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the basic regression diagnostics for spatial autocorrelation are introduced. These include the classic Moran's I test, as well as the Lagrange Multiplier/Rao Score tests for lag and error dependence developed during the 1980s and 1990s. In addition, the recent tests for the Spatial Durbin specification developed by Koley and Bera are covered as well. The tests are detailed in Anselin and Rey (2014), *Modern Spatial Econometrics in Practice* and in Anselin, Serenini and Amaral (2024). *Spatial Econometric Model Specification Search: Another Look* (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.10650.86721), as well as in the references therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the classic case with OLS estimates, a test for spatial correlation is covered for models with endogenous variables, estimated by means of 2SLS.\n",

    "Familiarity with OLS and 2SLS estimation in *spreg* is assumed, as covered in the respective notebooks, as well as basics of *numpy*, *pandas*, *geopandas*, and *libpysal*.

However, there may be some other misspecifications going on here, since the values of the robust tests are *larger* than their original counterparts, which is not standard behavior. In a strict sense, the robust tests are robust to *small* departures from the null and they should be *smaller* than the original test, since they *correct* for the ignored misspecification.

    "The inclusion of the hardship indication in the regression specification changes not only the interpretation of the regression coefficients, but also greatly affects the results for the spatial diagnostics. In the SAR-Error context, the LM-Lag statistic is still significant, but its robust form is not. There is now only the weakest of evidence for the Error case (5.705 with a p-value of 0.02). Neither of the robust tests are significant. The joint LM test (7.329) only achieves a p-value of 0.0256, which provides very weak evidence. On the other hand, Moran's I remains significant, but much less so than before (z-value of 2.619 with p=0.0088).\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is completely different on the Spatial Durbin front. Now, the values for the robust forms of the tests are smaller than the original counterparts, as they should be. There is strong evidence for an SLX alternative. Following the Koley-Bera (2024) recommendations, interest focuses on the robust forms of the one-directional tests, since the joint test is highly significant. The robust Lag test (5.705) is no longer significant for a p-value of 0.01 (p=0169), whereas the robust WX test (17.742) is still highly significant (p=0.0005). This would suggest an SLX alternative, or possibly, with a lower standard for significance (e.g., p=0.05), a Spatial Durbin model.\n",

    "The inclusion of the three SLX terms changes the estimates and significance of the other coefficients considerably. The **Hisp14P** variable is no longer significant, but its spatial lag is, with a large negative coefficient. All three SLX coefficients are significant. However, their magnitude and sign raise some concerns. It is very difficult to interpret a case where the coefficient of the neighbor's influence has a different sign from the original coefficient, as is the case for **Blk14P** and **W_Blk14P**. This suggests negative spatial autocorrelation, which is rare, but not impossible, although it runs counter to Tobler's first law of geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, obtaining a coefficient for WX that is larger than the corresponding coefficient for X suggests a stronger effect of the neighbors than for the location itself, which runs counter to the distance decay implied by Tobler's law. While this does not make the SLX specification invalid as such, it does require a careful consideration of the interpretation of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostics are only reported for the SAR-Error alternatives, since the WX term is already included in the model. This inclusion seems to have eliminated most evidence for remaining spatial autocorrelation. While Moran's I and the LM tests are weakly significant (but *not* for a p-value of p=0.01), the robust LM tests are not, and neither is the joint LM test.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would suggest that the inclusion of the SLX terms has taken care of the spatial autocorrelation *problem*. However, as mentioned, the signs and magnitudes of the coefficients are difficult to interpret and would demand closer scrutiny."

    "\n",
    "An alternative to maximum likelihood is to tackle the endogeneity of the spatially lagged dependent variable by means of instrumental variables (IV) estimation. This is implemented in the `spreg.GM_Lag` class. As before, the estimation of the Spatial Durbin model is achieved through the inclusion of the `slx_lags` argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distinct from what is possible for maximum likelihood, other endogenous variables can be included as well, using the familiar **yend** (for the endogenous variables) and **q** (for the instruments) arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treatment in this notebook will focus on the specific properties of the IV estimation. Generic properties of the spatial lag model, such as the different predicted values, residuals, and the impact measures will not be treated in detail again. Technical aspects pertaining to these issues are covered in the maximum likelihood notebook."

    "Note how the list of **Instruments** now consists of the second order spatial lags, even though `w_lags = 1`. This is because the spatial Durbin model already includes the first order lags as explanatory variables. Using first order lags as instruments would result in perfect multicollinearity. This is detected internally in `GM_Lag`, so that the computation of the lagged instruments is adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the case of ML estimation, the inclusion of the lagged explanatory variables has quite an effect, even though only **W_EP_NOHSDP** turns out to be significant (for ML, **W_HIS_ct** was significant as well). Also, the spatial autoregressive coefficient (0.509) is no longer significant. Three of the four lag coefficients (including the non-significant ones) have a negative sign, the opposite of the original regression coefficients. This raises the suspicion that the proper specification may be a spatial error model. The results of the Common Factory Hypothesis Test bear this out. At 4.083, it is *not* significant, which means that the common factor constraint can *not* be rejected. This contrasts greatly with the result for ML estimation, where the constraint was strongly rejected. However, given the lack of significance of the spatial lag terms, this needs to be interpreted with caution. A better strategy would be to consider further refinements of the model specification by eliminating some lag terms by means of `slx_vars`, as in the SLX model. This is not further pursued here.\n",

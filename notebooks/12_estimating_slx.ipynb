    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a closer look is taken at the estimation of SLX models, both the traditional linear specification as well as more recently introduced nonlinear forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `spreg` package implements the inclusion of spatially lagged explanatory variables in any specification by means of a non-zero `slx_lags` argument. This allows for the estimation of non-spatial linear models by means of OLS, as well as spatial Durbin and SLX-Error models by means of specialized methods. In addition, as of Version 1.7, the `NSLX` module introduces the estimation of nonlinear SLX models, such as a negative exponential distance function and an inverse distance power transformation. The `NSLX` module is still somewhat experimental and under active development, but the current version is stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarity with the basic setup of regressions in *spreg* as well as essentials of *numpy*, *pandas*, *geopandas*, and *libpysal* is assumed. In addition, it is assumed that the **chicagoSDOH** PySAL sample data set has been installed (for specific instructions, refer to the *sample data notebook*)."

    "## Estimating SLX Models\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Version 1.7 of *spreg*, several options to estimate the SLX model are available that go beyond the simple inclusion of spatially lagged explanatory variables by means of a non-zero `slx_vars` argument. A distinction is made between a linear model and a nonlinear model. In the linear model, both the usual row-standardized spatial weights are supported, as well as kernel weights (not row-standardized). The kernel weights can be conceived as introducing a form of nonlinearity, albeit in the weights and not in the coefficients. In contrast to other usage of the kernel weights (e.g., for HAC standard errors), in the SLX estimation, the diagonal elements are set to zero (and not kept as 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinear estimation is implemented for a negative exponential distance function and an inverse distance power function. Instead of using the actual distance between observations, which is dependent on the scale of the metric chosen (e.g., meters vs. miles), the actual distance within a given bandwidth (either fixed or adaptive) is converted to a fraction of the bandwidth distance, ensuring that its range is between 0 and 1. More precisely, the distance is converted to a fraction of the distance to the nearest neighbor within the bandwidth (for fixed bandwidth) that is farthest away. For an adaptive bandwidth, this is always the k-nearest neighbor, for a fixed bandwidth, it is typically to a nearest neighbor for less than k.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential model transformation is based on $e^{-\\alpha z_{ij}}$, where $z_{ij} = d_{ij}/bw$, for $d_{ij} \\le bw$, and zero otherwise. Note that the estimate for $\\alpha$ should be positive and larger than one. The negative exponential transformation is built-in, so that the estimate for $\\alpha$ should be a positive value. The current implementation in *spreg* has a different $\\alpha$ parameter for each explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the power model, the transformation is $z_{ij}^\\alpha$ with $z_{ij} = 1 - d_{ij}/bw$, for $d_{ij} \\le bw$, and zero otherwise. In this context, the estimate for $\\alpha$ should be positive and larger than one. Note that since $z_{ij} \\lt 1$, the power $z_{ij}^\\alpha$ quickly becomes negligible (i.e., basically zero) for larger values of $\\alpha$. Here too, a different parameter is estimated for each explanatory variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation of the NSLX model uses a nonlinear optimization routine that is quite sensitive to the model specification. In ill-behaved specifications, nonsensical parameter estimates may result. In some instances, the model may fail to optimize altogether, yielding a `nan` for the objective function. Such cases should be taken as an indication of a poor specification and alternatives should be considered. In addition, one should keep in mind that the estimated coefficients should be small. Large coefficients are applied to the transformed distance, which is a fraction less than one. For example, a coefficient of 10 in a power function applied to a z-distance of 0.2 results in a weight of 0.00000001, essentially zeroing out the lagged variable. Such large values can also easily result in singular covariance matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter estimates are also very sensitive to the choice of the bandwidth, a common attribute of kernel estimation methods. Since these are distance decay functions, larger values for the $\\alpha$ parameters imply a steeper decline with distance. Everything else being the same, the same actual distance decay will tend to yield larger parameter values for a larger bandwidth, and vice versa. Unlike what holds in the linear model, the actual parameter values are not easy to interpret in an absolute sense. However, their effect on the multipliers can be assessed by means of the methods covered in an earlier notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all models, there is the flexibility to only lag some of the explanatory variables. In addition, for the nonlinear models, it is possible to apply a different transformation to each variable. Unless there is a good theoretical reason to do so, this is generally not recommended.\n"

    "As mentioned, estimating nonlinear models can be quite tricky. The optimization routines are sensitive to model (mis)specifications and various numerical approximations can yield nonsensical results. So far, the `NSLX` module implements two specifications, a negative exponential distance function and an inverse distance power function. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NSLX` uses the `minimize` routine from `scipy.optimize` as the nonlinear optimizer. The default method is `BFGS` (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfard and Shanno), a quasi-Newton method that uses a numerical approximation for the first derivatives. Starting values for the parameters are the OLS regression estimates for the $\\beta$ coefficients and 1.0 for the $\\alpha$ coefficients (this is currently hard-coded). The optimization method also returns an approximation of the inverse Hessian, which can be used to compute asymptotic standard errors. However, as documented online in various forums, depending on the model, the approximation can be quite crude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the nonlinear SLX model consists of both a linear and a nonlinear part that are unrelated, the associated variance-covariance matrix is block-diagonal. The block for the linear part is the familiar $\\sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1}$, which is easy to compute. The block for the nonlinear part is $\\sigma^2 (\\hat{X}'\\hat{X})^{-1}$, where $\\hat{X}$ consists of vectors of partial derivatives with respect to the nonlinear parameters, with their final values substituted. Both blocks are relatively straightforward to compute analytically. Specifically, the expressions for the partial derivatives with respect to $\\alpha$ are $- e^{-\\alpha.z}.ln(\\alpha.z).z$ for the exponential model, and $z^\\alpha.ln(z)$ for the power model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinear part is notoriously ill-behaved, especially for the power model when the parameter estimates are much larger than one. In such instances, the model should be viewed with suspicion, given the problems with such powers, even though the numerical approximation may yield what looks like a valid variance-covariance function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NSLX` class takes a set of arguments that is slightly different from that for the other regression functions. As usual, `y` and `x` are required, but instead of passing spatial weights, a dataframe or numpy array with point coordinates is required as the `coords` argument. The coordinate values are used to build the scaled distance weights. The parameters for those weights are passed as `params`, which is a list of tuples consisting of three elements: the number of nearest neighbors (`k`), the bandwidth (`distance_upper_bound`), and the transformation. In the most typical application, the same parameters will be used for all the lagged variables so that only a single tuple needs to be specified in the `params` list. However, there is the flexibility to apply a separate set of parameters (and thus a different transformation) to each variable. The sequence of tuples in the list must match the sequence of variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of nearest neighbors is used to build the underlying KDTree, and also serves to derive the bandwidth. With the second item as `np.inf`, the bandwidth is adaptive and determined by the distance to the farthest k-nearest neighbor for each observation. For a fixed bandwidth, a distance upper bound must be specified. This is not trivial and depends on the scale of the coordinates (e.g., whether the distance will be in meters or kilometers). \n",
    "\n",
    "When a distance_upper_bound is set that is larger than the largest k-nearest neighbor distance, there is no effect. In order to be effective, the distance_upper_bound must be less than the maximum k-nearest neighbor distance for a given point. In this instance, it has the effect of imposing a fixed bandwidth, and it truncates the number of nearest neighbors to those within the bandwidth. As a result, the number of neighbors will be less than k. When a strict fixed bandwidth needs to be imposed, k should be set large enough (and `distance_upper_bound` small enough) so that the bandwidth is effective for every observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third argument is the transformation, either `\"exponential\"` or `\"power\"`. In contrast to the other SLX models, `slx_lags` is *not* an argument, but `slx_vars` remains available to impose selective lag transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other arguments include a flag for the type of variance computed, with `var_flag = 1` (the default) for an analytical computation, and `var_flag = 0` for the inverse Hessian approximation. There is also a flag for a listing of a summary of convergence conditions, with `conv_flag = 1` for such a listing (`conv_flag=0` is the default). Finally, there is a `verbose` flag which lists the intermediate results for all iterations (`verbose = False` is the default to avoid sometimes very long listings), and an option to include `minimize`-specific options, as `options`, a dictionary with specific solver options (see the `scipy.optimize` documentation at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "A final remark is that the results of nonlinear optimization may vary by hardware, operating system and software versions. As a consequence, slight differences in the parameter estimates may occur."

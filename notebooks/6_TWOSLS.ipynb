To correct for this bias, the violating *endogenous* variables are replaced by *instruments* that are: (1) uncorrelated with the error term; and (2) closely related (but not too close) to the original endogenous variables.\n",

    "The effect of correcting for potential endogeneity is again significant. In the OLS results, all coefficients except **EP_NOHSDP** are highly significant. However, in the 2SLS results, neither **Blk14P** nor **Hisp14P** are significant, but **EP_NOHSDP** becomes significant. Its coefficient also changes sign, from positive (but not significant, so essentially zero) to negative. This illustrates the importance of checking for potential endogeneity."

    "The Durbin-Wu-Hausman statistic (DWH) is a test for the endogeneity of some regressors, provided instruments are available. It is a simple F-test on the joint significance of selected coefficients in an augmented regression. The augmented regression specification consists of the original exogenous variables and predicted values of the endogenous variables when regressed on the instruments (those include the exogenous variables). If the null hypothesis holds, the coefficients of these predicted values should not be significant. The DWH test then boils down to an F-test on their joint significance (see Davidson and MacKinnon 2004, p. 338-340).\n",
